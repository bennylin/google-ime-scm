Installation
-------------
1. Install Google IME for your chosen language: http://www.google.com/ime/transliteration/
2. Download any of the [available transliteration schemes](https://github.com/ratreya/google-ime-scm/tree/master/Schemes).
3. Copy your chosen scheme file to Google IME Scheme's directory: [Google IME Canonical Scheme](http://www.google.com/inputtools/windows/canonical.html). The directory mentioned on the previous link is wrong (as of 5/2013). The correct directory for {language} is: ```C:\ProgramData\Google\Google Input Tools\com.google.input_tools.t13n.ime.{language}\schemes\```. ProgramData is usually a hidden directory under C:\\.
4. From Window's language bar select your language, in Google IME select your chosen scheme (Ctrl-M).
5. You can now start typing according to your chosen scheme into any Unicode aware application.
